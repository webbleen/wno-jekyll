# Wno - Jekyll

[Wno Jekyll](https://github.com/webbleen/wno-jekyll) is a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It is a port of my Ghost theme [wno](https://github.com/webbleen/wno), which is originally developed from [OneV-s-Den's Vno](https://github.com/onevcat/vno).

## Live Demo

See [Wno - Jekyll](http://wno.webbleen.com) site and [my blog](http://webbleen.com).

You can also find some instruction as well as other sites using Wno theme in [this page](http://wno.webbleen.com/2016/02/hello-world-wno/).
